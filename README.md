# Mini-game made in Python: throwing dice with the emperor

## Requisites
Python is the only requisite. It was made using Jupyter Notebook.

## Rules of the game
The game is based in the informations of this <a href='https://www.getty.edu/education/college/ancient_rome_at_home/pdf/tali_tesserae_game.pdf'>link</a>.
'Tali' is the name of this ancient type of dice, with four positions instead of the usual six of current days. It was used in the Ancient Rome for betting games, such as the one developed in this project.
The game rules are simple: each player throws four Tali and, based in the results, have to bet a certain amount of money. Most of the results possible don't give any consequence, except for the following:

<table>
 <tr>
  <th>Value of the Tali</th>
  <th>Name of the Combination</th>
  <th>Value to Bet</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>1-1-1-1</td>
  <td>Canis - The Dog</td>
  <td>3 pennies</td>  
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>All numbers the same (except 1), e.g. 3-3-3-3</td>
  <td>Vulture</td>
  <td>2 pennies</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>6 and any other combination</td>
  <td>Senio - The Six</td>
  <td>1 penny</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Combination of the four possible numbers> 1, 3, 4, 6</td>
  <td>Venus</td>
  <td>The player wins the game! All the money betted is theirs now!</td>
 </tr>
</table>
